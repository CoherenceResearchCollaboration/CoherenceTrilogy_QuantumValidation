Fine-Structure Constant Derivation from Recursive Geometry
Part of the Coherence Trilogy (Paper II)

This script derives the fine-structure constant (α) using two independent
geometric pathways: recursive angular containment and mass-ratio scaling.
Both match the CODATA 2018 value with precision better than 1.2e-7.
