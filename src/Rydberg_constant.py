Rydberg Constant Derivation from Recursive Geometry
Part of the Coherence Trilogy (Paper III)

This script derives the Rydberg constant (R_∞) using the Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM),
based on the fine-structure constant, Planck’s constant, and a structural correction factor λ.
The result matches the CODATA value to better than 1.5e-11 with no fitting.
